the [Cython](http://cython.org) project, which converts Python code to compilable C code; and the [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) project, which converts snippets of Python code to fast LLVM bytecode.\n","Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is safe to say that none of the three approaches has yet surpassed the reach and popularity of the standard CPython engine.\n","\n","The relative sluggishness of Python generally manifests itself in situations where many small operations are being repeated – for instance looping over arrays to operate on each element.\n","For example, imagine we have an array of values and we'd like to compute the reciprocal of each.\n","A straightforward approach might look like this:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sqXaKVdXKG_G","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606062711263,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":669,"user":{"displayName":"Rawan Alkurd","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qLDTurUmnGc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABTI/XF3dCZp8tqg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09937576995474160878"}},"outputId":"045fe256-3e29-4a8e-9a63-91efbefa2c67"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","np.random.seed(0)\n","\n","def compute_reciprocals(values):\n","    output = np.empty(len(values))\n","    for i in range(len(values)):\n","        output[i] = 1.0 / values[i]\n","    return output\n","        \n","values = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=5)\n","compute_reciprocals(values)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([0.16666667, 1.        , 0.25      , 0.25      , 0.125     ])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":1}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cnHFZ3ImzG-F","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606062736559,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":843,"user":{"displayName":"Rawan Alkurd","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qLDTurUmnGc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABTI/XF3dCZp8tqg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09937576995474160878"}},"outputId":"7c3897d7-6217-4c00-da39-dbc7bba6767a"},"source":["values"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([6, 1, 4, 4, 8])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"__aarCDYKG_H"},"source":["This implementation probably feels fairly natural to someone from, say, a C or Java background.\n","But if we measure the execution time of this code for a large input, we see that this operation is very slow, perhaps surprisingly so!\n","We'll benchmark this with IPython's ``%timeit`` magic (discussed in [Profiling and Timing Code](01.07-Timing-and-Profiling.ipynb)):"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LdNs0A45KG_H","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606062785143,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14766,"user":{"displayName":"Rawan Alkurd","photoUrl":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qLDTurUmnGc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABTI/XF3dCZp8tqg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09937576995474160878"}},"outputId":"95ca2bd9-8c99-49f9-82f5-ebbd33e81c43"},"source":["big_array = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=1000000)\n","%timeit compute_reciprocals(big_array)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1 loop, best of 3: 3.52 s per loop\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6sPQfDjLKG_H"},"source":["It takes several seconds to compute these million operations and to store the result!\n","When even cell phones have processing speeds measured in Giga-FLOPS (i.e., billions of numerical operations per second), this seems almost absurdly slow.\n","It turns out that the bottleneck here is not the operations themselves, but the type-checking and function dispatches that CPython must do at each cycle of the loop.\n","Each time the reciprocal is computed, Python first examines the object's type and does a dynamic lookup of the correct function to use for that type.\n","If we were working in compiled code instead, this type specification would be known before the code executes and the result could be computed much more efficiently."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gWcqG5VLKG_H"},"source":["## Introducing UFuncs\n","\n","For many types of operations, NumPy provides a convenient interface into just this kind of statically typed, compiled routine.
